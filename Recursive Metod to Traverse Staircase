 You're given two positive integers representing the height of a staircase and the maximum number of steps that you can advance up the staircase at a time. Write a function that returns the number of ways in which you can climb the staircase.

For example, if you were given a staircase of height = 3 and maxSteps = 2 you could climb the staircase in 3 ways. You could take 1 step, 1 step, then 1 step, you could also take 1 step, then 2 steps, and you could take 2 steps, then 1 step.

Input format:
height = [The height of the staircase]
maxSteps = [The maximum number of steps you can take at a time]

Examples

Input:
4
2
Output:
5
